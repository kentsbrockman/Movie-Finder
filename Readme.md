# Movie Finder

Here is a short project carried out during [The Hacking Project](https://www.thehackingproject.org/) bootcamp: a movie search interface based on API calls to ["The Open Movie Database"](http://www.omdbapi.com/).

---

## Setup

- Get your personal API key from ["The Open Movie Database"](http://www.omdbapi.com/)
- Download or clone this repository.
- In the root folder, create a file named "apikey.js".
- In this file, type `const omdbKey="[Your omdb API key]"`.

Have a nice day out there!
